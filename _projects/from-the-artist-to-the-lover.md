## Guidelines for Intimate Art

This ethics is practiced through six guidelines:
1. Created through __desire__.
  - _‘Interest’ is not interesting; engage with the world._
2. Driven by __not-knowing__.
   - _Releasing the control from the creative process. Abandon the idea of productivity._
3. Based on __affective__ exchanges.
   - _Feelings_.
4. Acts through __engagement__ between the artist, place and spectator.
   - _The artist becomes a lover, and the spectator becomes a lover._
5. Highlights the presence of the __body__.
   - _Where all these previous things come from._
